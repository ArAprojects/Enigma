# Enigma
I found setup and direction of the project was not hard to grasp and my issues stemmed from putting all the pieces together, particularly using my array of random shifts, and testing them properly. I do believe my foundation was a little lacking and caused some issues which were easily avoidable. That said it was a good learning experience and with another day or so I think I could have finished.
